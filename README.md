# Coveo Blitz 2022 Registration Challenge
This was a challenge at Coveo where we would be given a bunch of tetrominoes and would have to stack them into as small a square as possible. 
After the initial surprise at having been given an NP-complete problem, we figured out a decent mixed-integer linear-programming solution. The team 
we tied with has a great write-up. https://github.com/JesseEmond/blitz-2022-inscription
